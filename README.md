# RobloxScripts
These are roblox scripts! Everyday more scripts will be added
Note: Some of these may not work for free exploits, so I recommend you use Script Ware
Buy Script Ware: https://script-ware.com
To use these scripts: Install the .zip file for all the script or copy the code of the one you want
if you downloaded the .zip, then extract the .zip archive on your desktop or any location you want
then you can open your executor(Script Ware Highly Recommended) and import the scripts from the folder made by the zip archive
if you copied the code, you can go into your executor and paste it in their, but if you want to use the script again
go into a text editor and paste the code, and do Ctrl+S or Command+S if you are on mac, and save the file as 'scriptname.lua'
the name doesnt matter, the thing that matters is the .lua at the end, once you did that, go into your executor and click the OPEN FILE
option then select that .lua file you just made and the code will show in the code box.
